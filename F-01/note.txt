--> type conversion is when we manually convert
from one type to another.
One the other hand, type coercion
is when JavaScript automatically converts types
behind the scenes for us.not a number(NaN) actually means invalid number.JavaScript can only convert to three types.So we can convert to a number, to a string or to a Boolean.
