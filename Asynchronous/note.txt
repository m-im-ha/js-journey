Whenever a user declares a function with the async keyword in its declaration, it automatically implies a fact that this function or a method is ready to receive all of the asynchronous events on itself.
After this, we generally use await keyword which then waits for the results and then fetches it successfully.
After that, we store the fetched result in some random variable then display the result or use that result for several other purposes as per the requirement.
A function that uses Async/Await keywords will eventually hold their results for some little amount of time as compared with other normal functions.
Upon successful completion, the result may be used for further data operations within the code itself or may be displayed on the browserâ€™s console successfully.
